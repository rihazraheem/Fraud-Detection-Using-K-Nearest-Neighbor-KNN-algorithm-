# Fraud-Detection-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbor-KNN-algorithm-
Fraudulent Credit card transactions will be detected using a supervised machine learning method K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The model will be trained using a dataset of historical credit card transactions and subsequently evaluated on a holdout dataset containing unseen transactions. 


The dataset is from an open-source website, Kaggle.com.
